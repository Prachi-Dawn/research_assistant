# Overview

This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to automate the research and report generation process.

Instead of relying on a single LLM prompt, the project divides the work among specialized agents:

- Research Specialist
- Data Analyst
- Content Writer

Each agent performs a dedicated task, improving modularity, scalability, and output quality.

# Features

- Multi-Agent AI Workflow using CrewAI
- Internet Search using Serper API
- Groq LLM Integration
- Automatic Research
- Data Analysis
- Professional Report Generation
- Modular Architecture
- Easily Extendable
- Configurable through Environment Variables

# Workflow

The execution begins when the user provides a research topic.

Example:

```
Artificial Intelligence
```

The CrewAI framework then assigns responsibilities to different agents.

## Step 1 – Research Specialist

Responsibilities

- Search the internet
- Collect latest information
- Gather statistics
- Find expert opinions
- Verify sources

Output

```
Structured research notes
```

↓

## Step 2 – Data Analyst

Responsibilities

- Analyze research
- Identify trends
- Extract insights
- Compare different viewpoints
- Highlight important findings

Output

```
Analytical summary
```

↓

## Step 3 – Content Writer

Responsibilities

- Convert analysis into a readable report
- Improve readability
- Organize sections
- Generate professional documentation

Output

```
Final Research Report
```
